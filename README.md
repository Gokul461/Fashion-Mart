### 1. **Firebase Authentication**

- Users can sign up and log in using email and password, stored securely with **Firebase Authentication**.
- Firebase also handles user session management, ensuring that users are logged in and logged out smoothly.
  
**Sign In/Sign Up Process**:
- On the login page, users can enter their credentials to sign in or sign up.
- If the user is new, they can create an account by providing an email and password.
- If there are any errors (e.g., invalid email or weak password), **Toastify** notifications will display error messages.

### 2. **Cart Functionality**

- **Cart Management**: Users can add products to the cart, view their cart, and remove items.
- **Quantity Management**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in the cart.
- **Cart Summary**: The total price and discount (if any) will be displayed dynamically.
- **Toastify**: Notifications for adding/removing products from the cart.

### 3. **Wishlist**

- Users can add products to the **wishlist** for later viewing or purchasing.
- Wishlist is persistent across sessions, stored in **Firebase Firestore**.
- The wishlist is easily accessible through the user's profile dropdown.

### 4. **Search Functionality**

- A search bar allows users to quickly find products by name, category, and price.
- Search results are dynamically updated as the user types in the search query.

### 5. **Modern UI Design**

- The website uses **React.js** combined with **Bootstrap** for a responsive, mobile-first design.
